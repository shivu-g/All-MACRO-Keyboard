# All-MACRO-Keyboard
A QWERTY Keyboard turned to --> MACRO Control Surface

I'm a Music Producer, Video Editor, Coder and find most of the time doing some repetitive tasks on the go. So, I scripted the whole Functions (still in Progress) useful for my workflow and created a macro key which intercepted on a qwerty keyboard. This is Game-Changer Productivity Hack and is very Useful.

My Final Design: (until i received the Loupedeck)
